## 🍲 Future Books = _QiDex: Soul Snacks™ Collection_

> _Like Chicken Soup for the Quantum Soul, but with more edge, eyeliner, and evidence._

Examples:

|Title|Subtitle / Flavor|
|---|---|
|**QiDex: Lessons from Momma Used to Say**|_Wisdom with a wooden spoon and a wink._|
|**QiDex: For the Ones Who’ve Been Through It**|_Healing for the tired, the triggered, and the trying._|
|**QiDex: For Lovers, Fighters, and Late-Night Survivors**|_When love gets messy but you stay anyway._|
