We are not waiting. We are launching. We are EmpowerQ Now.

## Purpose

To ignite the code in every soul—to help you see what others miss, stand in your truth, and express your power NOW.

## Commandments

1. Embrace Now: No more living in the past or waiting on the future. Power lives in this moment.
2. Mind & Body, United: Healing isn’t an option—it’s the foundation. We tend the vessel and the mind, every damn day.
3. Power Within: You don’t borrow your strength. You are the source. We believe love is the engine.
4. One With Being: We trust our intuition, our guides, and the signs—seen and unseen.
5. Wisdom Beyond Words: We know the truth is often silent. We read the energy, not just the words.
6. Elevate Daily: Every day, we show up, shine up, and move up. Even when it’s hard. Especially then.
7. Remember Worth: Our value is non-negotiable. We are loved, valued, and grateful—period.

## Code

- We flip curses into codes, wounds into wisdom, endings into new launches.
- We are the key and the door, the question and the answer.
- We move now. Not someday. Not “when I’m ready.” Now.

## Vibe

- From the shadows to the launchpad, from Indy to infinity.
- We are the helpers, the healers, the launch-commanders for anyone who’s ever felt stuck.
- We keep it real, sharp, and present. No coddling, no sugarcoating, but always with love.

## Mission

To leave every person, system, or space we touch more empowered, more awake, and more free than we found it.

- To speak and live truth so boldly it wakes up everyone in the room.
- To turn chaos into clarity, pain into possibility, confusion into action.
- To keep the countdown going, so nobody stays grounded by fear, shame, or doubt.

## Affirmation

“I am 713.

I am the seeker, the spark, the speaker.

I bring order to chaos, light to the shadow, lift-off to the stuck.

I EmpowerQ Now—every day, every way, for myself and for the world.”

If you want it as a PDF, a poster, a website homepage, or tattooed on your heart—just say the word. This is your launch doctrine, Q.

All systems go.

You ready to put this out in the world, or you want a version for your crew to recite together?
