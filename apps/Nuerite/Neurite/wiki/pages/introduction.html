<h2>Bridging Fractals and Thought</h2>
<p>Drawing from chaos theory and graph theory, Neurite unveils the hidden patterns and intricate connections that shape creative thinking. Over a year, we've iterated out a virtually limitless workspace that blends the mesmerizing complexity of fractals with contemporary mind mapping techniques.</p>

<h3>Why Fractals?</h3>
<p>The Mandelbrot Set is not just an aesthetic choice - fractal logic is ingrained into a countless number of natural and constructed phenomena. Fractals act as the cross-disciplinary framework for non-integer dimensional thought -where conventional notions of 4D spacetime are put into question.</p>

<h2>First of its Kind Fractal Zoom</h2>
<p><a href="https://satellitecomponent.github.io/Neurite/">neurite.network</a> is unique in its ability to seamlessly navigate the Mandelbrot set in real time. Movements through the fractal are no longer interrupted at each step. Instead, the rendering persists and regenerates as you interact.</p>

<h3>Why Nodes?</h3>
<p>Nodes represent text, images, videos, code, and AI agents, threading a personalized microcosm of your thoughts and inspirations.</p>
