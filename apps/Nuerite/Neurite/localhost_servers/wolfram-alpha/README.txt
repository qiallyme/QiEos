Wolfram Alpha API Server
Overview
This is a Node.js server that uses Wolfram Alpha's API to fetch results based on a user query. This server is meant to be run locally and acts as an intermediary between the user's application and the Wolfram Alpha API.

Getting Started
Requirements
Node.js (v14.0.0 or above)
npm (usually comes with Node.js)
Installing Dependencies
All the Node.js library dependencies are listed in the package.json file. To install these dependencies, navigate to the directory containing package.json file and run the following command:

npm install
Running the Server
To start the server, navigate to the directory containing the index.js file and run the following command:

node index.js
The server will start running on localhost:3000 or the port set in your environment variables.

Usage
Once the server is running, it can accept POST requests at the endpoint /. The request body should include:

query: The query to send to Wolfram Alpha API.
apiKey: Your Wolfram Alpha app ID.
The server then returns a JSON response containing various pods with plaintext and image results, depending on the query and what Wolfram Alpha API returns.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the server, please check if you've followed all the instructions correctly. If the problem persists, feel free to open an issue on this repository.
