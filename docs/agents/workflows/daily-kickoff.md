# Daily Kickoff Workflow (Human + Agent)

1) Open repo; run Cursor with `docs/agents/kickoff.md`.
2) Approve plan → apply changes.
3) Run Auditor (`docs/agents/auditor.md`) → fix only TOP 1–3 issues.
4) Run Logger (`docs/agents/logger.md`) to append the session entry.
5) Open PR with `templates/change-summary.md` contents in description.
6) Paste PR link into today’s session entry (Logger can do this automatically).
