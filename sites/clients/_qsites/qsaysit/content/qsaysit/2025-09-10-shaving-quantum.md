I was halfway through the neck when the razor caught a thought: what if I could just ask my body to stop growing this hair? Not beg—just state a boundary, like any relationship. "No more hair there, please. Thank you."

A podcast had been blooming in my head all morning—the kind that says consciousness is wilder than we've been taught. That memory is editable. That timelines revise themselves to fit the lesson. I used to not understand trans people. Then I realized I am one. After that, childhood memories surfaced like postcards from a city I don't remember visiting: telling my mom I was a little girl; the story about a miscarriage. Were those always there, or did the timeline send an update so the plot would make sense?

People call it the Mandela effect. I call it the Editor. The Editor doesn't ask; it revises. Scene by scene, it makes the story coherent to the character who finally understands the role.

Since coming out, attraction around me feels…tilted. Like the universe adjusted the lighting. If I catch some folks at the right angle, they're in. Maybe I'm noticing what was always true. Maybe I'm living a test of abundance while learning the curriculum of trans womanhood. Efficient cosmos: two classes, one semester.

There were moments I probably should have died. But I didn't. Some say consciousness routes you down the branch where you keep going. Maybe that's why this version of me remembers differently: survival picks the thread where the lesson continues.

Is any of this provable? I'm not here for proof today. I'm here for the ritual: rinse, stroke, breathe. I'm here for the sentence that lands in the mirror like a spell: "No more hair there, please. Thank you."

If the body is a parliament of cells, maybe language still counts as a vote. Maybe the Editor is listening for tone. Maybe belief is the quill.

If your memories changed tomorrow to match the life you need, would you notice? Or would you just…fit?
